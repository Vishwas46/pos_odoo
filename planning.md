# Project Planning: All-in-One Odoo POS

## 1. Overall Goal

To develop and market a comprehensive, Odoo-based Point of Sale (POS) system for the German market. This system will integrate core POS functions with delivery service management (Lieferando, Wolt), seamless payment processing, and ensure compliance with German KassenSichV regulations.

## 2. Key Features & Modules

## 3. Milestones / Phases (Suggested)

1.  **Phase 1: Foundation & Setup (Est: 1-2 weeks)**
    *   Set up Odoo development environment (Docker).
    *   Install base Odoo `point_of_sale`.
    *   Basic configuration and testing of standard POS.
    *   Initial repository structure push.

2.  **Phase 2: KassenSichV Integration (Est: 3-6 weeks - *highly dependent on TSE choice*)**
    *   **Decision:** Choose certified TSE Provider (Hardware/Cloud).
    *   Obtain TSE hardware/service access.
    *   Obtain and install the certified Odoo integration module for the chosen TSE.
    *   Develop/adapt `l10n_de_pos_kassensichv` to work with the certified module.
    *   Rigorous testing of transaction signing and reporting.

3.  **Phase 3: Payment Gateway Integration (Est: 2-4 weeks)**
    *   **Decision:** Choose Payment Provider(s) and terminal hardware.
    *   Install/configure relevant Odoo `payment` modules.
    *   Develop `pos_integrated_payment` for seamless POS workflow (e.g., triggering terminal, handling responses).
    *   Test various payment scenarios.

4.  **Phase 4: Lieferando Integration (Est: 4-8 weeks)**
    *   Obtain Lieferando API Credentials and Documentation.
    *   Develop `pos_lieferando_integration` module:
        *   API Authentication.
        *   Order fetching mechanism (webhook or polling).
        *   Mapping Lieferando data to Odoo models.
        *   POS UI for viewing/managing orders.
        *   Status update mechanism back to Lieferando.
    *   Testing with sandbox/real API.

5.  **Phase 5: Wolt Integration (Est: 4-8 weeks - *can be parallel to Phase 4*)**
    *   Obtain Wolt API Credentials and Documentation.
    *   Develop `pos_wolt_integration` module (similar steps as Lieferando).
    *   Testing with sandbox/real API.

6.  **Phase 6: Refinement, Testing, and Deployment Prep (Ongoing)**
    *   User Interface improvements (`custom_pos_base`).
    *   Cross-module integration testing.
    *   Performance optimization.
    *   User documentation creation.
    *   Prepare deployment scripts/procedures.

## 4. Technology & Provider Choices (To Be Decided)

*   **Odoo Version:** [e.g., 16.0 LTS or 17.0]
*   **KassenSichV TSE Provider:** [e.g., Fiskaly, Deutsche Fiskal, Swissbit, Epson (Hardware)] - **DECISION NEEDED**
*   **Payment Provider(s):** [e.g., Stripe Terminal, Adyen, SumUp, Concardis/Nets] - **DECISION NEEDED**
*   **Hosting:** [e.g., Odoo.sh, Self-hosted AWS/Azure/Other, On-premise] - **DECISION NEEDED**

## 5. Development Process & Collaboration

*   **Branching:** Use Git Flow or GitHub Flow (e.g., `main`, `develop`, `feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`). Feature branches for all development.
*   **Code Reviews:** All code changes must be reviewed via Pull Requests before merging into `develop` or `main`.
*   **Task Management:** Use GitHub Issues or a dedicated project management tool (Jira, Trello).
*   **Communication:** Regular stand-ups, communication channel (Slack, Teams).
*   **Parallel Work:** Assign developers ownership of specific modules (e.g., Dev A on Lieferando, Dev B on Wolt, Dev C on Payments, Team Lead overseeing KassenSichV). Ensure clear API definitions if modules depend heavily on each other (e.g., via `pos_delivery_base`).

## 6. Key Risks & Open Questions

*   **KassenSichV Certification:** Ensuring the chosen TSE and its integration are correctly implemented and remain certified. Cost of TSE service/hardware.
*   **API Complexity & Stability:** Delivery/Payment APIs can be complex, change over time, and have rate limits or specific requirements. Requires ongoing maintenance.
*   **API Access:** Gaining timely access to partner APIs (Lieferando, Wolt).
*   **Odoo Expertise:** Requires developers familiar with Odoo's backend (Python/ORM) and frontend (JS/OWL).
*   **Scalability & Performance:** Ensuring the POS remains responsive under load, especially with multiple integrations.
*   **Market Competition:** Understanding existing solutions and differentiation.
